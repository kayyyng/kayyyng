Hi, I am Kay, a final year student double majoring in Decision Analytics and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Hong Kong.

I'm interested in:
1. Programming - I love writing programmes because it feels like solving a logic puzzle. I even wrote a programme for my friends to record and visualise their mahjong scores.
2. Data visualisation - My favorite programming language is R, especially ggplot2. A concise and visually pleasing figure speaks louder than words.
3. Applied AI - My study in Decision Analytics helps me demystify how AI works. I have finally understood the importance of the years of calculus and linear algebra studies as they are the backbone of machine learning algorithms.

In this github, you can find ?? repositories:

1. Final-Year-Project-on-COVID-19
In my final year project for Biomedical Sciences I evaluated methods to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmission rate from epidemiological and phylogenetic data. 

Highlight of the project:
- I summarised existing epidemiological methods for calculating relative transmission rates of pathogens from literature, analysed their relevancies to SARS-CoV-2 and the availability of their data inputs.
- I applied a model developed for an oseltamivir-resistant strain of H1N1 influenza that only require publicly available and published data, and obtained the relative transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as D614G, Alpha and Beta.
- I modified the model to fit the COVID-19 setting, such as using whole genome sequences instead of genotyping as it provides more insights about the tranmission history.
- I compared the inferred values obtained from this model and other published epidemiological models and concluded that this model can generate similar results using fewer and more accessible data sources.

The repository enclosed part of the codes used for constructing the inference model (e.g. main_all_country.R) and visualisation tool to monditor the COVID-19 progression (e.g. HK COVID-19 data.Rmd)
