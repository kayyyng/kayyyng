Hi, I am Kay, a final year student double-majoring in Decision Analytics and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Hong Kong.

### I'm interested in ...
1. Programming:
I love writing programmes as I see it as solving a logic puzzle. I even wrote a comprehensive mahjong score calculator for my friends to record, visualise and obtain statistics about their performance
2. Data visualisation:
My favourite programming language is R, especially ggplot2, as I believe that concise and visually pleasing figure speaks louder than words.
3. Applied AI:
My study in Decision Analytics helps me demystify how AI works. I have finally understood the importance of the years of calculus and linear algebra studies as they are the backbone of machine learning algorithms.

### In this github, you can find 3 repositories:

### 1. Final-Year-Project-on-COVID-19
In my final year project for Biomedical Sciences, I evaluated methods to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmission rates from epidemiological and phylogenetic data. 

Highlight of the project:
- I summarised existing epidemiological methods for calculating relative transmission rates of pathogens from literature, analysed their relevancies to SARS-CoV-2 and the availability of their data inputs.
- I applied a model developed for an oseltamivir-resistant strain of H1N1 influenza that only require publicly available and published data, and obtained the relative transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as D614G, Alpha and Beta.
- I modified the model to fit the COVID-19 setting, such as using whole genome sequences instead of genotyping as it provides more insights into the transmission history.
- I compared the inferred values obtained from this model and other published epidemiological models and concluded that this model can generate comparable results using fewer and more accessible data sources.

The repository enclosed part of the codes used for constructing the inference model (e.g. main_all_country.R). Feel free to reach out to me about the methodology and analysis.

### 2. Machine Learning
The repository enclosed different machine learning models I have come across throughout my study in Decision Analytics. The models are divided into two categories: 

- models using scikit-learn; and 
- models built from scratch

Not only I learned how to apply these models, I have also gained a deep understanding of objective function, optimisation algorithm, regularisation and feature engineering techniques. I am able to analyse the pros and cons of different machine learning algorithms and select appropriate methods based on the nature of datasets.

### 3. Data Visualization
Two R markdown work about COVID-19 is enclosed in the repository.

- "COVID-19 Mortality in Europe" is a school project about data visualisation. My topic is to study the reasons behind the large variance observed in COVID-19 mortality rates within Europe. It visualised the relationship between mortality rates and other factors, such as urbanisation rate, the prevalence of COVID-19 testing and the capacity of public hospital systems.
- "HK COVID-19 data" is a tracker I made for myself to observe the transmission landscape in Hong Kong. It obtains data from the Centre for Health Protection directly and calculate the effective reproductive number as a time series.
